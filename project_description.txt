Project Title: Chess Encryption Algorithm

Project Description:
The Chess Encryption Algorithm is a program that generates an encryption string using chess moves.
The program takes a plain text message as input and converts it into an encrypted message using a series of chess moves.

The encryption process is as follows
1. Obtain chess game via a repository
2. Use 3 random variables to obtain any random game , a random color(black or white) and a random move number
3. access the move for game using the random variables obtained in step2
4. use this as an encryption text

The decryption code at the recipient is as follows
