Project Title: Chess Encryption Algorithm

Project Description:
The Chess Encryption Algorithm is a program that generates an encryption string using chess moves.
The program takes a plain text message as input and converts it into an encrypted message using a series of chess moves.

The encryption process is as follows
1. Obtain chess game via a repository
2. Use 3 random variables to obtain any random game , a random color(black or white) and a random move number
3. access the move for game using the random variables obtained in step2
4. use this as an encryption text

The decryption code at the recipient is as follows
.........

To decrypt the message, the recipient would need to reverse the process by converting the chess moves back into binary codes and then converting the binary codes back into ASCII characters.

The program would include a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input their plain text message, select a chessboard, and generate the encrypted message. The program would also include a decryption function that allows the recipient to enter the encrypted message and the chessboard used to generate the encryption, and retrieve the original plain text message.

To implement the program, you would need to create a chessboard representation in the program, which would include a mapping of each square on the board to a binary code. You would also need to create a function that converts binary codes into chess moves and vice versa. The program would be written in a high-level programming language such as Python or Java.

The program could be extended to include additional encryption methods, such as using different chess pieces to represent different binary codes or using a different chess variant like 3D chess or chess960. It could also be extended to include additional features such as password protection, file encryption, and network encryption.
